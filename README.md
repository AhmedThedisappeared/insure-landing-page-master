# Frontend Mentor - Insure landing page

![Design preview for the Insure landing page coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

## The challenge

My challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My users are able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
